### 👋 About Me  
I'm an Engineering Management graduate student at Northeastern University with a background in Computer Science.  
I’ve led projects across AI, sustainability, and social platforms — turning research and analytics into products that serve real user needs.

As a Business Analyst Intern, I helped streamline CRM and e-commerce solutions by mapping workflows, visualizing data, and improving cross-team delivery using tools like **JIRA, Figma, Power BI, and SQL**.

---

### 🔍 I’m Interested In Roles Like:
- **Product Manager / Associate Product Manager**
- **Business Analyst / Product Analyst / Data Analyst**
- **Technical Business Analyst / Implementation Specialist**
- **UX Researcher / Market Research Analyst**

> 📌 GitHub showcases my prototypes, analytics, and product-backed case projects — for process tools & coordination frameworks (Scrum, Kanban, RAID, etc.), check my résumé.
